## ABOUT
TelSwitch, Inc. has worked on over a thousand matters involving wage and hour, Telephone Computer Protection Act (“TCPA”) and commercial disputes, and is respected for its’ objectivity and rich insights into litigants’ data.

Our motto, “Bringing insight into life’s digital fingerprints”, is the result of weaving together millions of distinct data points into fact patterns that law firms can rely upon at various stages of litigation, which can be used to objectively describe events that occurred without confirmation bias.

## DATA ANALYTICS
Since 1994, TelSwitch, Inc. has been on the forefront of applying sophisticated techniques toward the analysis of large data sets. We do this by implementing the latest technologies, such as GRAID’s GPU-based data acceleration, in order to expedite the consumption of large datasets and then conduct analysis on that data to draw out insights from the data that might not otherwise be possible. TelSwitch, Inc. is honored to have been entrusted by dozens of law firms on behalf of both defendants and clients who have successfully navigated over a thousand matters in which we have been retained as experts.

## HISTORY BACKGROUND OF TELSWITCH, INC.
Our story began in 1991 when TelSwitch, Inc.’s founder presented a mock-business to his high school economics class based upon the premise of how designing a more efficient digital phone switch could lead to more cost effective transmission of phone calls. After graduating, that business became a reality, and in 1994, TelSwitch, Inc. was incorporated in California.

Although TelSwitch, Inc. started off as a telephone service provider, we quickly became recognized as a leader in the development of hardware and software for use with transmitting phone calls and then then collecting and rating those telephone calls. After divesting our retail assets, TelSwitch, Inc. focused our commitments on bring solutions to other telephone companies, to whom we licensed our unique hardware and software.

## EXPERTISE
As described by our tagline, “Bringing insight into life’s digital fingerprints”, we are experts in weaving data points into a thread of consistency and continuity that can be measured to achieve objectivity in litigation. We believe that by building a narrative around data, we can remove the emotions from evidence that is used in developing fact patterns related to class-action lawsuits to allow data to be used in a more persuasive manner. During the construction of these narratives, we use a combination of python, visual studio and ABBYY in the conversion of the data into database form, and Structured Query Language, or SQL, to analyze it.

## FUTURE
In 2024, TelSwitch, Inc. began incorporating NVIDIA’s GPU-driven data acceleration into our in-house SQL data warehouses using a product called GRAID to achieve a drastic increase in the efficiency of our back office data processing capabilities. We have achieved a measurable increase in the expediency of data processing and in increasing the timeliness in delivering results to customers.
