				<h2>Data Analytics</h2>
				<p>
					Since 1994, TelSwitch, Inc. has been on the forefront of applying sophisticated techniques
					toward the analysis of large data sets. We do this by implementing the latest
					technologies, such as GRAIDâ€™s GPU-based data acceleration, in order to expedite the
					consumption of large datasets and then conduct analysis on that data to draw out insights
					from the data that might not otherwise be possible. TelSwitch, Inc. is honored to have
					been entrusted by dozens of law firms on behalf of both defendants and plantiffs who have
					successfully navigated over a thousand matters in which we have been retained as experts.
