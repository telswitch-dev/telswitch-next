				<h2>Expertise</h2>
				<p>
					True to our tagline <em>“Bringing insight into life’s digital fingerprints”</em>, we are
					experts in weaving multiple data points into a thread of consistency and continuity. The
					results are then accurately measured to achieve maximum objectivity in litigation.
					TelSwitch, Inc. believes that building a narrative around data can remove the emotions and
					bias from evidence in developing fact patterns related to class-action lawsuits. This
					allows data to be used in a more persuasive manner. During the construction of these
					narratives, we use a combination of <strong>Python</strong>,
					<strong>Visual Studio</strong> and <strong>ABBYY</strong> in the conversion of the data
					into database form as well as Structured Query Language, or SQL, for accurate analysis.
