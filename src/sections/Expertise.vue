				<h2>Expertise</h2>
				<p>
					As described by our tagline, “Bringing insight into life’s digital fingerprints”, we are
					experts in weaving data points into a thread of consistency and continuity that can be
					measured to achieve objectivity in litigation. We believe that by building a narrative
					around data, we can remove the emotions from evidence that is used in developing fact
					patterns related to class-action lawsuits to allow data to be used in a more persuasive
					manner. During the construction of these narratives, we use a combination of python,
					visual studio and ABBYY in the conversion of the data into database form, and Structured
					Query Language, or SQL, to analyze it.
